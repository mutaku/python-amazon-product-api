0.2.5 (in development) "Buttercup"
----------------------------------

- Support for XSLT requests.
- Support for Associate tags thanks to Kilian Valkhof.
- New API versions 2010-09-01 and 2010-08-06 added.. 
- Fixed #16: Cannot install module under Python 2.4 without pycrypto being 
  installed first.


0.2.4.1 (2010-06-23)
--------------------

Bugfix release! High time I get some continuous integration set up!

- Fixed #13: The module did not run under Python 2.4. Ooops!


0.2.4 (2010-06-13)
------------------

- Locale parameter is now required at initialisation. ::

      # before you could write
      api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY)
      
      # now you have to specify your locale
      api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY, 'de')

- Custom test server (``tests.server.TestServer``) added. It runs on localhost 
  and mimicks the Amazon webservice by replaying local XML files.
- Testing now supports multiple locales. Please not that you have to run 
  ``python setup.py test`` to run the unittests.
- ResultPaginator now also works with XPath expressions for attributes (Bug 
  reported Giacomo Lacava).
- Custom lookup for XML elements (during parsing) ensures that ``<ItemId/>``
  and ``<ASIN>`` are now always ``objectify.StringElement`` (Bug reported by 
  Brian Browning).
- Fixed #11: Module can now be installed library without lxml being installed 
  first.
- Regular expressions for parsing error messages can now deal with the Japanese
  version.

  .. warning:: The support for the Japanese locale (``jp``) is still very 
     experimental! A few error messages have still to be translated and the
     functionality has to be confirmed. If you know Japanese, get in touch!


0.2.3 (2010-03-20)
------------------

- Tests run now for all API versions. Test cases can now be told which versions
  to use (class attribute ``api_versions`` set to i.e. ``['2009-10-01']``).
- A custom AWS response processor can now be defined. For instance, here is one 
  using ``xml.minidom`` instead of ``lxml``::
      
      def minidom_response_parser(fp):
          root = parse(fp)
          # parse errors
          for error in root.getElementsByTagName('Error'):
              code = error.getElementsByTagName('Code')[0].firstChild.nodeValue
              msg = error.getElementsByTagName('Message')[0].firstChild.nodeValue
                  raise AWSError(code, msg)
              return root
          api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY, processor=minidom_response_parser)
          root = api.item_lookup('0718155157')
          print root.toprettyxml()
          # ...
      
- Fixed #3: Support for API Version 2009-11-01.
- Fixed #4: When using a bad parameter combination, an 
  ``InvalidParameterCombination`` exception is raised. 
- Fixed #5: ``InvalidSearchIndex`` is raised when unknown ``SearchIndex`` is 
  specified.
- Fixed #7: Specifying API versions works now for more than just one test per 
  test case.
- The ``setup.py`` command has been empowered a bit with the following 
  additional options: ``test``, ``build_sphinx``, ``upload_sphinx``.
- ``ResultPaginator`` attributes ``_get_current_page_numer``, 
  ``_get_total_results`` and ``_get_total_page_numer`` are now private.


0.2.2 (2010-01-30)
------------------

- ``browse_node_lookup`` operation added.	
- ``help`` operation added.	
- ``list_lookup`` and ``list_search`` operations added.
- Default timeout for API calls is set to 5 sec.
- Test cases for correct parsing of XML responses added. Local XML files are
  used for testing (if available) stored in separate directories 
  according to API version. These can be overwritten when config value
  ``OVERWRITE_TESTS`` is set to ``True``.
- ``InvalidItemId`` exception is replaced by more general 
  ``InvalidParameterValue`` exception.	


0.2.1 (2009-11-20)
------------------

- Support for Python 2.4 added. 
- Fixed #2: ResultPaginator now returns ``None`` if the XPath expression doesn't 
  find the node it's looking for.
