    Wrapper class for the Amazon Product Advertising API. You will need both an
    AWS access key id and the secret counterpart.

    Example::

        AWS_KEY = '...'
        SECRET_KEY = '...'

        api = ProductAdvertisingAPI(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY, 'us')
        root = api.item_lookup('9783836214063', IdType='ISBN',

        total_reviews = root.Items.Item.CustomerReviews.TotalReviews.pyval
        review_pages = root.Items.Item.CustomerReviews.TotalReviewPages.pyval

    It is possible to use a different module for parsing the XML response. For
    instance, you can use ``xml.minidom`` instead of ``lxml`` by defining a
    custom result processor::

        def minidom_response_parser(fp):
            root = parse(fp)
            # parse errors
            for error in root.getElementsByTagName('Error'):
                code = error.getElementsByTagName('Code')[0].firstChild.nodeValue
                msg = error.getElementsByTagName('Message')[0].firstChild.nodeValue
                raise AWSError(code, msg)
            return root
        api = API(AWS_KEY, SECRET_KEY, processor=minidom_response_parser)
        root = api.item_lookup('0718155157')
        print root.toprettyxml()
        # ...

    Just make sure it raises an ``AWSError`` with the appropriate error code
    and message. For a more complex example, have a look at the default
    LxmlObjectifyResponseProcessor class.

        three refurbished, and three collectible items. Or, for example, if
        there are no collectible or refurbished offers, ``ItemSearch`` returns
        three new and three used offers.

        Because there are thousands of items in each search index,
        ``ItemSearch`` requires that you specify the value for at least one
        parameter in addition to a search index. The additional parameter value
        must reference items within the specified search index. For example,

        IDs of the children and ancestor browse nodes are also returned.
        ``BrowseNodeLookup`` enables you to traverse the browse node hierarchy
        to find a browse node.

        As you traverse down the hierarchy, you refine your search and limit
        the number of items returned. For example, you might traverse the
        following hierarchy: ``DVD>Used DVDs>Kids and Family``, to select out
        of all the DVDs offered by Amazon only those that are appropriate for
        family viewing. Returning the items associated with ``Kids and Family``
        produces a much more targeted result than a search based at the level
        of ``Used DVDs``.

        Alternatively, by traversing up the browse node tree, you can
        determine the root category of an item. You might do that, for
        example, to return the top seller of the root product category using
        the ``TopSeller`` response group in an ``ItemSearch`` request.

        You can use ``BrowseNodeLookup`` iteratively to navigate through the

    def cart_create(self, items, **params):
        """
        The ``CartCreate`` operation enables you to create a remote shopping
        cart.  A shopping cart is the metaphor used by most e-commerce
        solutions. It is a temporary data storage structure that resides on
        Amazon servers.  The structure contains the items a customer wants to
        buy. In Product Advertising API, the shopping cart is considered remote
        because it is hosted by Amazon servers. In this way, the cart is remote
        to the vendor's web site where the customer views and selects the items
        they want to purchase.

        Once you add an item to a cart by specifying the item's ListItemId and
        ASIN, or OfferListing ID, the item is assigned a ``CartItemId`` and
        accessible only by that value. That is, in subsequent requests, an item
        in a cart cannot be accessed by its ``ListItemId`` and ``ASIN``, or
        ``OfferListingId``. ``CartItemId`` is returned by ``CartCreate``,
        ``CartGet``, and ``CartAdd``.

        Because the contents of a cart can change for different reasons, such
        as item availability, you should not keep a copy of a cart locally.
        Instead, use the other cart operations to modify the cart contents. For
        example, to retrieve contents of the cart, which are represented by
        CartItemIds, use ``CartGet``.

        Available products are added as cart items. Unavailable items, for
        example, items out of stock, discontinued, or future releases, are
        added as SaveForLaterItems. No error is generated. The Amazon database
        changes regularly. You may find a product with an offer listing ID but
        by the time the item is added to the cart the product is no longer
        available. The checkout page in the Order Pipeline clearly lists items
        that are available and those that are SaveForLaterItems.

        It is impossible to create an empty shopping cart. You have to add at
        least one item to a shopping cart using a single ``CartCreate``
        request.  You can add specific quantities (up to 999) of each item.

        ``CartCreate`` can be used only once in the life cycle of a cart. To
        modify the contents of the cart, use one of the other cart operations.

        Carts cannot be deleted. They expire automatically after being unused
        for 7 days. The lifespan of a cart restarts, however, every time a cart
        is modified. In this way, a cart can last for more than 7 days. If, for
        example, on day 6, the customer modifies a cart, the 7 day countdown
        starts over.

        The ``CartAdd`` operation enables you to add items to an existing
        remote shopping cart. ``CartAdd`` can only be used to place a new item
        in a shopping cart. It cannot be used to increase the quantity of an
        item already in the cart. If you would like to increase the quantity of
        an item that is already in the cart, you must use the ``CartModify``
        operation.

        You add an item to a cart by specifying the item's ``OfferListingId``,
        or ``ASIN`` and ``ListItemId``. Once in a cart, an item can only be
        identified by its ``CartItemId``. That is, an item in a cart cannot be
        accessed by its ASIN or OfferListingId. CartItemId is returned by
        ``CartCreate``, ``CartGet``, and ``CartAdd``.

        To add items to a cart, you must specify the cart using the ``CartId``
        and ``HMAC`` values, which are returned by the ``CartCreate``
        operation.

        If the associated CartCreate request specified an AssociateTag, all
        ``CartAdd`` requests must also include a value for Associate Tag
        otherwise the request will fail.

        .. note:: Some manufacturers have a minimum advertised price (MAP) that
        can be displayed on Amazon's retail web site. In these cases, when
        performing a Cart operation, the MAP Is returned instead of the actual
        price. The only way to see the actual price is to add the item to a
        remote shopping cart and follow the PurchaseURL. The actual price will
        be the MAP or lower.

        the active area of a cart to the SaveForLater area or the reverse.

        To modify the number of items in a cart, you must specify the cart
        using the CartId and HMAC values that are returned in the CartCreate
        operation. A value similar to HMAC, URLEncodedHMAC, is also returned.
        This value is the URL encoded version of the HMAC. This encoding is

        in a URL. Rather than encoding the HMAC yourself, use the
        URLEncodedHMAC value for the HMAC parameter.

        You can use ``CartModify`` to modify the number of items in a remote
        shopping cart by setting the value of the Quantity parameter
        appropriately. You can eliminate an item from a cart by setting the
        value of the Quantity parameter to zero. Or, you can double the number

        as availability, you should not keep a copy of a cart locally. Instead,
        use ``CartGet`` to retrieve the items in a remote shopping cart.

        To retrieve the items in a cart, you must specify the cart using the
